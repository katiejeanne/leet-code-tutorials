# An introduction to graph problems with LeetCode 200 - Number of Islands

## Understand the problem

- How do we count all the islands without counting an island more than once?
- How do we count a group of connected cells as a single island?
- How do we know when we are encountering a new island?
- How do we travel across the map programatically?

## Traveling across the map

## Breadth first or depth first?

### Depth first search

### Breadth first search

## Keeping track of visited islands

## Look at every cell for an unvisited island

## Return the island count
